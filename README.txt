# Welcome to our implementation of pong!

## How to play
### Menu
By default, use the W and S keys to cycle through menu items. 
Use the Enter key to choose a menu option. 
You can press the esc key to exit the game at any time. 

### Gameplay controls
In gameplay, the default controls for the paddle are:
- W and S for player 1
- Up and Down arrow for player 2
You can pause the game at any time with the P key. 
You can quit the match with the esc key. 
(note that all controls can be changed from the settings)

### Gameplay mechanics
As the player, your goal is to stop the ball from passing your paddle, while making tricky shots to score at your opponent's side. If you let the ball through, you lose a life. Whoever depletes their opponents lives first wins the game! As the game progresses, the ball gains speed so stay alert! Depending on how to hit the ball, its angle changes to give you the edge in the game. Use strategically placed balls to get past your opponent! 

### Extra features
Other than the bare essentials, we added some more fun features you might enjoy!
- As the match progresses, a crowd will react accordingly. So make sure to crank up that volume!
- The game includes easy, hard and impossible computer players. You can even pit two computers players against each other for the true screensaver experience!
- As you have noticed, we implemented a menu to let you adjust settings settings like volume, keybinds and the properties of your next match. 
- The menu also includes a nice title screen
- You can pause the game during gameplay if you want a quick break (or to gain superhuman reflexes)
- You can quit the game with the esc key, useful for if you're about to lose.
